								<h3>Why LineUp?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
							 	The concept for LineUp came after working as a freelance barber for many years. I heard about the difficulty my clients had while trying to find a reliable barber...before coming to me of course :) 

							 	But seriously, the barbers who taught me the craft were losing business after the economy went sour. So that lit a flame inside me to try to come up with a solution. 

							 	LineUp is a web application I built to learn Rails that allows users to find barbers by zipcode.

								<h3>My Role</h3>
							</header>
							<p> 
								To be honest this was a personal project I was passionate about, so I designed, did the front-end development and back end development for the site. My original objective was to create an Uber for barbers while using the Yelp API to help rate haircuts. But I ralized the key with the project was to kick off my coding journey, not overwhelm my self. Plus, haircuts are subjective, so why rate them?

								<h3>Challenges</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								As a newbie to designing and coding, building a site with the functionality I wanted this site to have was very complex with the skill set I had at the time. Such as having two different types of users(barbers and customers) who could log in. Creating the social capabilities to follow friends for these two types of users, liking pictures, uploading pictures, using AJAX to search for barbers. Setting up Amazon Web Services to upload pictures to the cloud! The challenges were never ending! So I had a friend named Quincy who had more of an affinity toward Rails and he helped me out with the logic when I struggled. We struggled together! And we learned a ton.

								<h3>The Aftermath</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								LineUp helped me gain confidence in my abilities - I've easily put in 300 - 400 hours of learning with this project while iterating through designs. I should add that I was charged $3,000 by Amazon for exposed keys on GitHub, lesson learned. <br><br>I went from having an idea, recognizing the challenges and building an actual website with limited coding skills. I've found while working as a designer, many times we think of endless possibilities because 'it can't be that hard' they say, but I've devleoped empathy for the limitations developers may find when trying to build something. Through all the mistakes I made with this project, it truly has made me grow as a professional and as a human being.
