								<h3>WORKING AT FANDANGONOW</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Currently I work on the design team at FandangoNOW as a UX Designer. If you're not familiar, FandangoNOW was once called M-GO before being acquired by Fandango in early 2016. My main focus since joining FandangoNOW has been User Interface and Interaction Design for desktop, TV and android devices.
							</p>
							<p>
								While at M-GO I worked on front-end development, illustations and asset production. Below you'll see a few early illustrations I designed that were used as welcome gifts for new employees at M-GO. Its always fun to look back on where I started and the growth I've experienced in my career so far.

								<h3>Team Process</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Before jumping into details about any recent work, I want to break down how our team collaborates.
							</p>
							<p>
							 	Usually our design team receives a set of requirements from stakeholders. We'll then have a sketch session based around those requirements where we discuss different solutions. Our sketches get handed off to one visual designer who takes a pass at combining our ideas - usually this designer has the most context for that specific platform. Then we'll get together again to iterate on that designer's idea before coming up with a final solution. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The sign up page which you can see below went through this entire process before I could finalize the design. It was one of the first pages worked on for our brand redesign transitioning from M-GO. And the goal was to communicate our benefits to new users signing up for our service their first time, while trying our best not to confuse our current users.

								<h3>Recent Work</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								One of the large challenges over the past couple years while Fandango has been acquiring new companies has been making our platforms feel consistent - or at least feel like they come from the same family (Fandango, FandangoNOW, Flixster, Rotten Tomatoes, etc.). For the past year we have explored a variety of different graphical treatments and interactions that are still in the works to unify all of our different properties. Below you'll see a few conceptual animations I came up with for FandangoNOW's onboading and loading screens.

								<h3>Brand Guide Lines</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Working on the brand guidelines was the first major project I was involved in at M-GO and it was also our first initiative for Design 3.0, a design overhaul of our website. A major problem in the past was that the site was originally designed with various colors and font sizes - so over time it became difficult for developers to maintain consistency within their code. Our goal was to define reusable components that would look familiar to our iOS and Android products, but also have a consistent feel across all of our platforms.

								<h3>Design 3.0</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								After developing a solid foundation of fonts, button sizes and colors, we divided different sections of the site to work on. My job was to help clean up our navigation, create new assets that would be used on promotional pages and make pages responsive. The overall objective was to make the site look more modern while educating users about differences from other entertainment services.

<!-- 							<em>
								Our previous navigation was cluttered with icons and text while our hero image assumed that new users understood what M-GO was about. 
							</em> -->
							<!-- <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/mgo_after3.png" alt="" /></a> -->
<!-- 							<em>
								This image shows what our redesigned site looked like. Elements had more white space, we used a grid system and our home page showed considerably less content than before. This became a base of styles for web that we still use today at FandangoNOW. -->

								<h3>Deadpool Web Takeover</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								One of the first marketing initiatives we had to excite people about FandangoNOW came during the release for Deadpool. Being that Deadpool is a funny dude to be a superhero, we had him proudly peek from behind our gutters if the user scaled their browser full screen. 
							</p>

								<h3>Android TV</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								After a few months of pushing hard on marketing initiatives and creating some brand awareness, the goal was to get on more devices. One of those being Android TV! 
							</p>
							<p>
								I worked on the general style guidelines for the app which included (margins, font-sizes and colors). I also worked on the layout and UI for a few screens throughout the TV app along with my team. 
							</p>

								<h3>Android App Redesign - Coming Soon</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Currently I'm focused on the entire redesign of our Android mobile app which has been a lot of fun to work on. Below you'll see a reskin that I worked on mid 2016. The new app that's being redesigned will be a great upgrade from our current app - we'll have more material compliant interactions and better ease of use for our Android users.

								<h3>Fandango Movie Metrics</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Fandango Movie Metrics was the first project I ever lead as a designer. I worked with multiple stake holders from CFOs, Sales Executives, Product Managers and Developers all to make this come to fruition.
							</p>
							<p>
								Eventually this turned into a product that was sold to a few  movie studios who would use it to gage marketing efforts for certain movies. Users would be able to  compare earnings from opening weeks and chase weeks. They could also compare how certain movies performed relative to other movies in the same genre in specific regions of the country. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Not only did this experience build my confidence as a designer, but it helped me understand the nuances of building dashboards. There were limitations with using a third party service such as Tableau so I had to compromise design for functionality at times. In all, a lot of education and experience was gained from this project. 
							</p>

								<h3>Future Endeavors</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								So far over the course of my career in the last 4 years I've aimed to become a full stack designer with a keen understanding of marketing. I didn't go to business school, but through pushing my creative limitations and not being afraid of failure, I've learned that I want to become a design lead who can mentor others and build a solid team around me at some point in the future. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I want to be someone who understands the possibilities, constraints and timelines of how far we can go. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Working on personal side projects have helped me become self aware that I like every aspect of design from conceptual ideation to problem solving through execution and iteration. Every moment of understanding the customer, stakeholders and the intent of what we're trying to accomplish is a step forward. But what I'd truly like to become overall in the near future is an alchemist who can be the bridge the gap between design and marketing. As well as a person who can foster creativity and motivate others on my team to become their best selves everyday. Design is profession I love because I can always be a student, but I get the greatest sense of accomplishment from mentoring and helping my team get through this thing called life.
