								<h3>Working at Fandango NOW</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								I worked on the web design team at M-GO before we recently got bought by Fandango. And today our service is called Fandango NOW where I focus on UI and UX Design for desktop and mobile. When I started my job, our company began a rebuilding phase and my bosses thought it was a fun idea to create avatars of our new co-workers...kind of like a welcome gift. Below are a few illustrations of the Content Ops team who wanted their avatars to be based off the popular late 70s movie 'Alien'!

								<h3>Brand Guide Lines</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Working on the brand guidelines was the first major project I was involved in at M-GO and it was also our first initiative for Design 3.0, a design overhaul of our website. The site was originally designed with various colors and many different font sizes - over time it became difficult for developers to maintain consistency within their code. Our goal was to define reusable components that would look familiar to our iOS and Android products, but also have a consistent feel across all of our platforms.

								<h3>Design 3.0</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								After developing a solid foundation of fonts, button sizes and colors, we divided different sections of the site to work on. The objective was to make the site look more modern while educating users about differences from other entertainment services.

								Our previous navigation was cluttered with icons and text while our hero image assumed that new users understood what M-GO was about. 
							</em>

							<em>
								Through out the redesigned site, elements have more white space, we used a grid system and our home page showed considerably less content. The Rewards icon is also more prominent to peak the curiousity of one of our biggest differentiators.

								<h3>Front End Development and Design</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								During Design 3.0, I updated the code for a couple pages of the M-GO website such as the<a href="http://www.mgo.com/hdr"> hdr page</a>. Two of my most recent designs that went live are the <a href="https://www.mgo.com/devices">Devices page</a> and <a href="https://www.fandangonow.com/redeem">Redemption page</a>. I experimented with <a href="https://scrollpassionbyjd.firebaseapp.com/"> parallax scrolling</a> in order to explore concepts for promotional pages.<br><br> 
								I think interaction design is at an interesting time right now where animations are becoming more used to educate users on how to use products. Especially with material design catching on. I've enjoyed dabbling with animations using jQuery, GSAP, CSS and javascript. Although I don't consider my self a javascript ninja, it is an area where I'd like to continue growing along with my visual design skill set. You can checkout my Codepen experiments like <a href="http://codepen.io/dudu06/full/Qjobqv/"> this</a> or see some of my recent  work below that shows before and after designs of current and future web pages.

								Our current settings page uses multiple drop down menus and this is something we wanted to change.

								The revised settings page uses a panel styled lay out that allows for scannable content.
