								<h3>Working at Fandango NOW</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Currently I work on the web design team at FandangoNOW as a UX/UI Designer. Our company used to be called M-GO before getting acquired by Fandango. My focus is on visual design for desktop and mobile, but I've jumped in on front-end development as well. And my more recent projects involved designing for AndroidTV, iOS and Android apps. Below are a few early illustrations I designed when I started at M-GO. We used them as welcome gifts to new and existing employees so its fun to look back on where I started and how I've grown.

								<h3>Brand Guide Lines</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Working on the brand guidelines was the first major project I was involved in at M-GO and it was also our first initiative for Design 3.0, a design overhaul of our website. A major problem in the past was that the site was originally designed with various colors and font sizes - so over time it became difficult for developers to maintain consistency within their code. Our goal was to define reusable components that would look familiar to our iOS and Android products, but also have a consistent feel across all of our platforms.

								<h3>Design 3.0</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								After developing a solid foundation of fonts, button sizes and colors, we divided different sections of the site to work on. My job was to help clean up our navigation, create new assets that would be used on promotional pages and make pages responsive. The overall objective was to make the site look more modern while educating users about differences from other entertainment services. 
							</p>

							<!-- <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/mgo_before3.png" alt="" /></a> -->
							<em>
								Our previous navigation was cluttered with icons and text while our hero image assumed that new users understood what M-GO was about. 
							</em>
							<!-- <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/mgo_after3.png" alt="" /></a> -->
							<em>
								This image shows what our redesigned site looked like. Elements had more white space, we used a grid system and our home page showed considerably less content than before. This became a base of styles for web that we still use today at FandangoNOW.

								<h3>Team Process</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								So before jumping into details about my recent work, I wanted to break down how our team works together. During our time at M-GO my boss and I directly managed the website from design to code while two other designers managed our applications. 
							</p>
							<p>
							 	Usually our design team receives a set of requirements from multiple product or project managers. We then have a sketch session based around those requirements where we'll discuss different solutions. We'll hand off all of our sketches to one visual designer who takes a pass at combining our ideas. Then we'll get together again to iterate on that designer's idea before coming up with a final design. 
							</p>
							<p>
								If the requirements are straight forward enough, our Lead UX Designer creates low fidelity wireframes that get handed off to me or another designer. 
							</p>

								<h3>Sign Up Page</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								One of the first things I worked on after our transition from M-GO to FandangoNOW were our sign up pages for web. The challenge was that I had to create an elegant solution that relayed a lot of information that could be discerned very quickly to a new user. Any time someone went through a checkout flow as a non-user, we had to provide some of the benefits potential users would get if they decided to join FandangoNOW. The sign up page had to remind them why they were signing up, to purchase and watch the movie - in the example above, Deadpool, while giving a few bullet points about our service. 
							</p>

								<h3>Deadpool Web Takeover</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								One of the marketing initiatives any time we had a huge release on FandangoNOW, was to create a full scale image that would flush the gutters on the home page to support the promotion of that particular release. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Our marketing team was sent a few images from the studios that were approved to use. Then I created some assets, mocked up how the page should look and handed off to our lead web developer. 
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/recent-work-3.jpg" alt="" /></a>

								<h3>Android TV Popcorn/ Various Assets</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								After a few months of pushing hard on marketing initiatives and creating some brand awareness, the goal was to get on more devices. One of those being Android TV! 
							</p>
							<p>
								I didn't have any substantial experience working on a TV app so this was a good place to start. In the example above you'll see an image of popcorn which I designed to represent a placeholder image for missing episode iconics. Before we were using generic mountain images and I was asked to create something that would feel a bit friendlier. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I also designed the buttons in multiple densities, gift card pages and various scrim images when the app is launched. My boss was the guy who designed the overall layout. 
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/recent-work-4.png" alt="" /></a>
							<header>
								<h3>Android App Reskin</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Toward the middle of 2016 one of our goals was to get featured in the Google Play store. After getting some advice on how to do that we decided that making the app more Material compliant would be a top priority. 
							</p>
							<p>
								At the time our app utilized a very dark color scheme and elements appeared flat through out the app. My job was to choose a color scheme that fit with our brand guidelines while making elements appear more Material friendly. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Since most of our platforms consistently use a dark color scheme with a standard set of colors, this proved to be a challenging task. Utilizing lighter colors would feel inconsistent while using darker tones that we don't actually use in other places would do the same. 
							</p>
							<p>
								So in order to fulfill the requirement, I worked with shades of gray - which are part of our brand. Not the ideal resolution, but we decided we should work on other platforms while building a consistent set of components before touching this again. So iterations of this will be coming soon.  
							</p>

								<h3>Fandango Movie Metrics</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Fandango Movie Metrics was the first project I ever lead in terms of design. I worked with multiple stake holders from CFOs, Sales Executives, Product Managers and Developers all to make this come to fruition.
							</p>
							<p>
								Eventually this turned into a product that was sold to a few  movie studios who would use it to gage their marketing efforts with certain movies. Users would be able to learn how much a movie earned opening week and compare that with chase weeks. They could also compare how certain movies performed relative to other movies in the same genre in specific regions of the country. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The unique challenge with this project was learning to deal with multiple personalities and egos. Sales people wanted to make things "pop" more on certain pages. Developers wanted to have their opinion on how things should be designed. Product Managers had different goals. And as a Designer I had to keep us focused on the end goal. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The key was to build a sense of comradary among one another to see it through. This was a project where I had to be empathetic toward my team as well as the end user. But I also had to balance being an authoratative voice of design. If that meant listening to opinions I would truly sit down and listen, if it meant taking the time to educate developers on design principles I did it. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Not only did this experience build my confidence as a designer, but it also helped me understand the nuances of building dashboards. There were limitations with using a third party service such as Tableau so I had to compromise design for functionality at times. 
							</p>
							<p>
								At the moment we're letting users feel their way through what we built. So it will be interesting to get some feedback on where we can improve. 
							</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Future Endeavors</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								At the moment FandangoNOW is in a unique position we weren't in a year ago when we were M-GO. We've become a more visible brand, we have more customers and with that comes a ton of new challenges that not only deal with design. How do we break through the noise of an industry where multiple streaming apps are trying to do the same? How do we accomodate more data? 
							</p>
							<p>
								As of late I've become more educated on using analytics tools such as Alexa Analytics, Compete and Quantcast to hone in on who are audience is. I've worked with the Business Intelligence team to learn where are e-commerce is succeeding and where we can improve. 
							</p>
							<p>
								These are things that give context to what features we build and help us hone in on keeping things simple. Before we had no clue if users understood our designs, we just worked based on assumptions. Now we do user testing! As much as I love design, its been my goal to help make us a household name. And if that means getting out of my comfort zone and having a deep dive into analytics, I'll do it. Design is a field where you could never stop learning. FandangoNOW has been a great ride so far and I'm looking forward to what the future holds. 
							</p>
