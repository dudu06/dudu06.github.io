								<h3>Why ChicFit?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Social apps help us connect with friends, find restaurants and create relationships. Yet there is nothing on the market to help people choose outfits in a way that entertains at the same time. ChicFit was another personal project I designed that was inspired by my girlfriend's indecisiveness with choosing outfits. I'm constantly bombarded with questions like, "Does this look good?", "These ear rings or these ones?" And then I'd see that my female friends would often Snapchat pictures with the same questions! The concept of ChicFit was fun and really got me curious to see what kind of solution I could come up with to solve this worldwide dillema...

								<h3>Sketches</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Usually I begin projects by thinking about a problem I want to solve. This time the problem is that friends are group texting pictures to one another if they need help with style based decisions. And sometimes the person responding to a text probably wont do so until hours later. The opportnity is that we live in an age where people are becoming more transparent with their lives through social media, why wouldn't they want help with choosing outfits?<br><br>I sketched out and ideated a solution that would satisfy the user requirements of the app. While designing ChicFit I wanted users to be able to do several things:<br>
								- The ability to upload pictures<br>
								- Vote on other users pictures<br>
								- View a tallied percentage of votes for style based decisions<br>
								- View other user profiles<br>
								- View personal notifications<br>
								- And be able to search for styles by hashtag or name<br>

								<h3>Wireframes</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								After having an idea of what features I wanted to implement in to the app while white boarding, I moved on to creating high fidelity wireframes of different views in Sketch. I then used Marvel App to create a clickable prototype and check if any of the interactions didn't make sense.

								<h3>Pixel Perfecting</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								During the wireframing process I learned that visual imagery was an important aspect of the app. The idea was to create an experience that could be in the realm of other apps like Rent the Runway, Stylect and Wishbone. I also went through several color palletes while looking for a neutral, but fun and elegant feel that could appeal to women and men.

								<h3>Iterate</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								The app design is simple, but there is always room for improvement. Since the app is designed to appeal to younger demographics, I thought the use of icons without descriptive text could be enough to articulate interactions. One of the more important things I'd like to continue improving is the use of elegant typography. Overall, my goal was to create a product that was seamless to use, but easy enough to learn how to use.

								<h3>User Flows</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								When users come to a site, its kind of like entering an unfamiliar home or store. Where's the bathroom? What aisle can they find the jello? These are tasks that they want to accomplish and we must create solutions to solve their problems in the most effective interaction possible.

								<h3>Create Wireframes</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Once we have our site navigation set up, we need to ask whether the interactions users encounter make sense. How do we do that? Create some low or high fidelity wireframes depending on the scope of the project and then move on to good ol' prototypes!

								<h3>Conduct Usability Tests</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								After we create something to work from, usability tests can allow us to see how people are using what we built. The assumptions go out the door at this point since the interactions we intend to happen might not actually happen the way we expect. Reiterate from here time and time again until coming up with a solution that gives us the best result...
